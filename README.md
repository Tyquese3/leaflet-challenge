Earthquake Visualization

Overview

This project focuses on visualizing earthquake data using Leaflet and D3.js. It retrieves real-time earthquake data from a GeoJSON API and represents the data points on an interactive map.

 Create the Earthquake Visualization

Map 

 Ensure that the base map tiles are correctly loaded without any rendering issues.

Fetch earthquake data using D3.js from the designated API.

 Adjust marker sizes proportionally to the magnitude of each earthquake.

 Implement a legend that explains the color representation for different depth levels.

Data Points 

Earthquake markers should be sized appropriately based on their magnitude.

Implement a color scale that varies according to earthquake depth.

 Display an informative tooltip for each marker when hovered over.

 Ensure that earthquake data points appear accurately on the map.

Setup Instructions

Clone this repository.

Install dependencies using npm install (if applicable).

Open index.html in a browser or use a local development server to view the map.

Technologies Used

Leaflet.js for map visualization

D3.js for data fetching and binding

GeoJSON API for real-time earthquake data
